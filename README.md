## A live data visualization app for covid-19 statistics worldwide. I fetched the data from disease.sh API endpoint. I used Leaflet for the map which was not so friendly to implement but integrated well at the end. Also, I used ChartJs for graph presentation which could be more pleasing potentially but I just didn't bother more with styling. Additionally, I integrated a bit of react thing by having different themes which changes according to the selected view by the user.
